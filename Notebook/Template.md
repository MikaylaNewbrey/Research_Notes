# DNA Extraction from Marine Samples  

## üìù Notes  
- **Samples collected at 3 locations**: Site A, Site B, and Site C.  
- Initial concentration measurements suggest **low DNA yield at Site B**.  
- PCR amplification results were **inconclusive**, requiring re-extraction.  
- Unexpected **contamination detected** in Site C sample.  

## üìå Next Steps  
- [ ] Perform a second DNA extraction for Site B samples  
- [ ] Run **gel electrophoresis** to verify PCR results  
- [ ] Filter seawater samples again to remove potential contaminants  
- [ ] Meet with Dr. Smith on **2025-02-16** to discuss protocol changes
